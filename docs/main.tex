\subsection{Basic Components}
The following are the most basic components that are present in most genetic algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fitness function for optimization.
    \item Population of chromosomes.
    \item Selection of chromosomes for reproduction.
    \item Crossover to produce the following generation of chromosomes.
    \item Random mutation of chromosomes in the following generation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Fitness Function}
Fitness is a term from biology which defines the extent to which a certain type of organism is able to pass itself onto the next generation, based on the way a given organism does its job. It can be stated with the following question: which survival form will pass the most copies of itself onto the next generation?
